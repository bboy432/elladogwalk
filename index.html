      <h2>Hi there! I'm Ella, and like most kids, I love dogs!  But instead of just playing fetch, I'm learning all about being a dog walker and running my own business (it's called entrepreneurship, grown-ups tell me!).  I'm super excited to take your furry friend on tail-wagging adventures and give them all the love and exercise they need.  Together, we can make your pup happy and help me learn a bunch too! </h2>
      <p>it costs $5 per walk, i will come pick it up</p>
